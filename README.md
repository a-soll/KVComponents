# KVComponents
Decided to open source some of the code that powers Kulve. This repo isn't for providing ready-to-use libraries, but rather a place to browse some of the code that powers the app. It's really just a place for people who are curious to get a look at how things work behind the scenes.

It's possible in the future that I'll end up making these components into more formal libraries that can be used in general iOS/macOS apps, but for now, they're too ingrained into Kulve.
